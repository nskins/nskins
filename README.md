### Hey, I'm Nicholas!

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at Vehlo working on best-in-class solutions for the automotive care industry.

I'm interested in functional programming, machine learning, computational complexity, and various other fields. I have contributed to notable open-source projects such as [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7256), [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon/pull/439), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/2366). In addition, I have maintained a niche open-source library called [Goby](https://github.com/nskins/goby) which enables users to create their own console games with ease.

I'm also an avid runner! Here are some notable accomplishments:
- **Marathon**: 3:08:13
- **24 Hour Run**: 110 miles
