### Hey, I'm Nicholas!

My interests include programming language concepts, web development, and game development. For example, some recent interests in the above domains are as follows:
- asynchronous runtimes ([Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio), etc.);
- the [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) + [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) stack; and
- the [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) game engine.

I'm also an avid runner! My personal record in the marathon is 3:17:31!
