### Open-source Contribution Hall of Fame

Here are some highlights of my open-source contributions:
- [Λ ⚬ λ](https://github.com/cpeikert/lol): in the summer of 2016, I worked with a research team at the University of Michigan on a key-homomorphic pseudorandom function application in a state-of-the-art lattice cryptography library. [Check out my commit history!](https://github.com/cpeikert/Lol/commits/master/?author=nskins)
- [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon): I fixed example applications for the Elixir programming language's premier neural network library (see PRs [#439](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon/pull/439), [#441](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon/pull/441), etc.). 
- [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix): Various documentation fixes for Elixir's very-loved web application framework (see PRs [tailwind#56](https://github.com/phoenixframework/tailwind/pull/56), [phoenix_live_view#2489](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/pull/2489), etc.).
- And, of course, any of my humble little personal repositories!
